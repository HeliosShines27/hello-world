A Loser's Repository

I am a loser. I wasted 6 years of my life getting a degree. I got a degree but didnt get the knowledge I desired. I have no respect in my office or my love life. The only people who stand by me are my parents. I somehow never find the push to do something. All I like to do is sleep, eat and play games. But that doesnt give me my daily bread so I am a self sympathetic loser who keeps whining in life and never tries to improve. If you need to understand the meaning of "Good for nothing" or "Waste of Birth", I am it. I get told by trash people just because they had the brains and the interest to upgrade their knowledge while I kept playing games. Now this is an attempt to learn something. But I am pretty sure I am not potent enough to see this through and I will stop doing this in a day or two.

I dont look good. I have no personal hygiene. I am fat. Zero at health, Zero at Knowledge. Waste of Life.
